    <h2>Introduction to IoT and Cybersecurity</h2>
    <div style="color:lightgray">
        <p>
            The Internet of Things (IoT) is a revolutionary concept that refers to the network of physical devices, vehicles, appliances, and other objects embedded with sensors, software, and connectivity. These devices can collect and exchange data, enabling them to interact and make intelligent decisions without human intervention.
        </p>
        <p>
            IoT has brought about significant advancements in various fields, including healthcare, transportation, manufacturing, and smart homes. It has the potential to enhance efficiency, productivity, and convenience in our daily lives.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, with the rapid proliferation of IoT devices, cybersecurity has become a critical concern. As IoT devices are interconnected and often collect sensitive data, they are vulnerable to cyberattacks and breaches. Malicious actors can exploit security weaknesses in IoT devices to gain unauthorized access, compromise user privacy, or launch large-scale attacks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cybersecurity in the context of IoT involves implementing measures to protect IoT devices, networks, and data from unauthorized access, manipulation, and theft. It includes strategies such as authentication, encryption, access control, secure communication protocols, and regular security updates.
        </p>
        <p>
            As an IT student, I am fascinated by the immense potential of IoT and its impact on our lives. I am particularly interested in exploring the intricate relationship between IoT and cybersecurity. I am dedicated to acquiring knowledge and skills to contribute to the development and implementation of robust cybersecurity practices in the IoT domain.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my ePortfolio, you will find projects, research, and insights related to IoT and cybersecurity. I believe that by addressing the challenges associated with IoT security, we can unlock the full potential of this technology while ensuring the safety and privacy of users.

    <div style="color:lightgray">
        <p>
            Understanding the key concepts of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) is crucial in the field of cybersecurity. Confidentiality ensures that sensitive information is only accessed by authorized individuals, preventing unauthorized disclosure. Integrity ensures that data remains accurate and unaltered, safeguarding against unauthorized modification. Availability ensures that systems and data are accessible when needed, minimizing disruptions and ensuring business continuity. These three pillars form the foundation of a robust cybersecurity strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Addressing cybersecurity issues requires a range of competencies. Technical skills, such as network security, encryption, and vulnerability management, are essential. Understanding threat landscapes, risk assessment, incident response, and security awareness are also critical. Additionally, non-technical skills, such as communication, problem-solving, and critical thinking, are vital for effectively addressing cybersecurity challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to technical competencies, awareness of ethical and governance frameworks is crucial in information systems security. Adhering to ethical principles ensures responsible and accountable behavior, promoting trust and integrity in handling sensitive data. Knowledge of data protection acts and regulations, such as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), helps in establishing compliant and secure information systems. Understanding the ethical and governance frameworks surrounding cybersecurity enables professionals to navigate legal and ethical challenges while protecting data and privacy.
